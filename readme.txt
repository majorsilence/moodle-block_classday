Currently there is no option to configure the classday (/daily schedule) block 
from within moodle.  The only option is to configure it manually in sampleconfig.txt 
and classday.css.

SampleConfig.txt is used to configure 
*startdate - The first day of the school year
*enddate - The last day of the school year
*daycount - The number of days in a cycle
*pd - Professional development days
*holiday - All holidays

classday.css can be used to configure the display properties of the text that shows
within the block.  Any valid css styles can be applied.
